It discusses the approaches taken by challenge participants and identifies four classes of algorithms used by the submitted agents: Single-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Hierarchical DRL, Ensembles, and Non-DRL approaches. The hierarchical DRL approach was found to be the most capable of learning an effective cyber defensive strategy. The analysis of agent policies revealed that different algorithms within the same class produced diverse strategies, and the defensive Blue agent's strategy varied depending on the offensive Red agent's strategy. The paper concludes that DRL algorithms are suitable for autonomous cyber defence applications.",cyberautonomygymforexperimentationcagechallenges
